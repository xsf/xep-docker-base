2011-01-19  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* Texml/handler.py: wrapper around strip() to support very
old python version
* scripts/texml.py: version number is changed to 2.0.2.

2006-07-20  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* Texml/texml.py: try to write a symbol in the ^^XX form first,
and only then consult the rewriting maps. Otherwise combination
of --encoding and --ascii gives undesired result.
* scripts/texml.py: version number is changed to 2.0.1.


2006-07-10  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* TeXML 2.0.0 release.


2006-06-14  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* Texml/handler.py: one raise was incorrectly commented-out.
* scripts/texml.py: version number is changed to 2.0.0.beta1.
* scripts/texml.py: the first line now is just "#!python", the
path is to be corrected by distutils.


2006-06-02  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* Texml/specmap.py: mapping for the non-breaking hyphen,
as suggested by Paul Tremblay.


2006-06-01  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* Texml/specmap.py: "|" is now "\textbar".


2005-10-03  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* scripts/texml/texml.py: First line now is "#!python".
* scripts/texml: New file.
* scripts/texml_local: Old content of PYTHONPATH is retained.
* tests/data/quick/Makefile: Switched from using "texml.py" to
using "texml_local".
* setup.py: Version string is extracted from "scripts/texml.py".
* MANIFEST.in: HTML and text documentation is added.
* README: typo is fixed.


2005-09-26  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* texml.py: Version number is updated: 1.29.devel.
* texml.py: Default width now is 62 symbols.
* texmlwr.py: If symbol couldn't be translated to an encoding,
  command "\unicodechar" is written instead of an #&xNNN; entity.


2005-09-07  Oleg Parashchenko  olpa@users.sourceforge.net

* texml.py: Version number is updated: 1.28.devel.
* dtd/texml.dtd: Element "pdf" is added.
* handler.py, texmlwr.py: Support of the element "pdf".
* data/pdfstring.xml, data/pdfstring.out, faildata/pdfstring.xml,
  faildata/pdfstring.grep, test/readme: Tests for the "pdf" element.
* handler.py: doesn't print error on it's own. Instead, returns the
  text to the caller, and caller should print the message.
  The function "__print_error" is deleted. The format "prefix:\n"
  is changed to "prefix: ".
* unimap.py: no more "&lt;" and "&gt;" instead of "<" and ">".
  Thanks Felix Wiemann for reporting the bug.

Version 1.27.devel (20 June 2005)

* New feature: "--ascii" parameter. Now it's possible to
  generate plain ASCII TeX files in a desired encoding.
  Non-ascii bytes are encoded as "^^XX".
  The test file "chinese1.xml" is a working example of
  a Chinese LaTeX file.

* TeXML issues a warning is an XML symbol isn't converted to
  TeX and printed as '&#xNNN;'

* Refactoring. Code for tuning output stream is moved from
  "handler.py" to "texmlwr.py".


Version 1.26.devel (8 May 2005)

* Bug is fixed. Now lines which consist of space characters and
  tabulation characters are also regarded as blank lines.


Version 1.25.devel (4 April 2005)

* Script texml_con
  This script can directly convert a texml 
  document to a print document such as PDF.

* External entities now handled
  A small bug in handler.py prevented external 
  entties from being read. External entities
  can now be read.


Version 1.24.devel (21 March 2005)

* TeXML is now namespace aware
  will process documents with the namespace 
  http://getfo.sourceforge.net/texml/ns1

  will also process documents with no namespace

* TeXML is installed the standard way
  libraries are created in the python path;
  scripts are automatically installed in the path

* Error handling
  
  exceptions are now classes rather than strings. 
  This allows for better handling of exceptions.

  Column and line numbers are now outputed as part 
  of the error messages when an exception is raised.

  exceptions for invalid or ill-formed XML are now
  handled in the script. Instead of a long message
  (incomprehensible to non-python developers), the
  error message consists of a column number, a line
  number, and a simple explanation. 
  

Version 1.23.devel (5 March 2005)

* ConTeXt mode is now enabled through command line instead of
  using the environment variable.


Version 1.22.devel (21 February 2005)

* Support of ConTeXt environments (\startenv ... \stopenv)
  Thanks to Paul Tremblay for the patch. More details:

Version 1.21.devel (18 February 2005)

* TeXML now should work under Python 2.2.1.
  Thanks to Paul Tremblay for the bug report and the fix suggestion:
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1123627&group_id=102261&atid=631460


Version 1.20 (12 November 2004)

* Jason Santos <jason.santos@megaslow.net> has proofread the documentation.
* Corrected DTD: attribute spec/@cat now allows the value "nl?".


Version 1.15.devel (17 August 2004)

* New category of special items: conditional newline.


Version 1.12.devel (09 August 2004)

* New document: Thesis of the talk at the First International
  Conference of Open-Source Developers.
* Names of distribution packages now contain suffixes '-windows'
  and '-unix' to reflect a difference in line endings.


Version 1.09.devel (08 July 2004)

* Environments and groups are now allowed in parameters.
* Whitespace processing in environments is reworked. Now @nl2
  attribute of <env/> regards possible <opt/> and <parm/>.
* Empty line, produced by <spec cat="nl"/>, is no longer being
  commented out.


Version 1.08.devel (29 June 2004)

* Advanced whitespace processing now implemented: the program
  (a) removes what XML regards as insignificant whitespace, and
  (b) introduces its own whitespace which would look reasonable
      from a human point of view.
* A new attribute @ws of the element <TeXML/> is responsible for
  switching advanced whitespace processing on and off.
* New attributes of <cmd/>: @nl1 and @nl2, new attributes of
  <env/>: @nl1, @nl2, @nl3 and @nl4. They are responsible for
  creation of new lines.
* New <spec/> symbols: new line, whitespace and nothing.
* Whitespace after commands is now significant, so the program
  adds '{}' after a command. This behaviour is configurable.
* A new command-line paramater '-w' (or '--width') specifies
  minimal width of lines that are subject to automatic line
  breaks.
* Translation of special characters is now more LaTeXish.
  For example, the symbol '<' is now translated into '\textless'
  instead of '$<$'.
* Replacements for special symbols now have '{}' characters at
  the endings instead of a space.
* Accurate handling of unicode mappings that can appear only in
  text or in math modes.
* License is changed from the GPL to the Lesser GPL.
* Improved documentation, added a quick start document.


Version 1.01.devel (06 May 2004)

* Added version number output.
* The program now deletes leading spaces in <env/>.
* Element <env/> now supports sub-elements <opt/> and <parm/>.
  Elements <parm/> and <opt/> now support sub-element <group/>.
  Thanks to Stephen Robertson for his request for improvements.


Version 1.00 (09 April 2004)

* More ligatures are being processed: ``, '', ?`, !`. With -- and ---
  they cover all default non-letter TeX ligatures.
* Simon Goodson is proofreading the documentation.


Version 0.98.beta (02 April 2004)

* Text of specification is now better. Thanks Simon Goodson for
  ideas on improvement.
* New handling of tags <parm/> and <opt/>. The processor now outputs
  them instantly as they appear, and so multiple parameters of one
  <cmd/> are not being united.
* Absence of spaces after LaTeX commands in some mappings is fixed.


Version 0.95.beta (26 March 2004)

* Ligatures "--" and "---" are being processed. This is configurable.
* Escaping of TeX specials is configurable.
* Translation of empty line is configurable.
* Default encoding of output now is ascii, not utf8.
* ChangeLog file is created.


Version 0.91.beta (22 March 2004)

* Under Windows, TeXML processor now creates lines with DOS endings.
  Code should also work correctly in other systems (MacOS etc).


Version 0.90.beta (19 March 2004)

* First packaged version of the TeXML.
