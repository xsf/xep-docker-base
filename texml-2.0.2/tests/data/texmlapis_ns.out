\section{What is \TeX MLapis?}
\TeX MLapis translates \TeX ML documents into \TeX{}.\par{}
\section{What good is \TeX ML?}
\LaTeX \footnote{\href{http://www.latex-project.org/}{http://www.latex-project.org/}}
is very good at a
  number of very tricky things.  These include formatting mathematical
  formulae, laying out out books and articles, typesetting text and tables in
  a pleasing and consistant manner, etc.  However, XML is good at a number of
  things \LaTeX{} is {\em{}not} so good at, such as being easily parsed and
  translated into a variety of output formats.\par{}
Unfortunately, the standard XML transformation system XSL\footnote{\href{http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/}{http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/}}
is not powerful enough to
  translate from normal XML formats to \LaTeX{} directly.  So when you use XML
  to edit, store, and distribute your source documents, \TeX ML provides the
  bridge you need to leverage the power of \LaTeX{} when formatting your
  document for the printed page.\par{}
The DTD and other documentation about \TeX ML\footnote{\href{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}}
is available
  from IBM
  alphaWorks\footnote{\href{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}}.  My interpretation of their software license does not allow
  me to redistribute those materials here.\par{}
\section{\TeX MLapis vs. \TeX MLatte}
There is already a \TeX ML-to-\TeX{} translator called \TeX MLatte\footnote{\href{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}}, but I
  was completely unable to get it to work.  It's written in Java\footnote{\href{http://java.sun.com/}{http://java.sun.com/}}
and the perhaps the runtime engines I
  have around are drastically sub-standard or something, but for whatever
  reason I could not get their tool to run.  Also, the software license for
\TeX MLatte is rather less community-oriented than the GPL, so I thought a
  new implementation was in order.\par{}
\TeX MLapis is written in pure Perl 5 and requires nothing but a standard
  Perl\footnote{\href{http://www.cpan.org/ports/}{http://www.cpan.org/ports/}}
interpreter.  It has it's own
  little XML parser built in.  Of course in order for it to be useful you'll
  need at least \LaTeX{} and almost certainly an XSLT processor as well. It was
  written entirely without reference
  to the \TeX MLatte code, which I have never even seen, so there shouldn't
  be any copyright entanglements.  I cannot guarantee that it will produce
  results
  identical to \TeX MLatte, but it has worked well enough for my purposes and
  seems to comply with available specs and examples.\par{}
\section{How to get it}
This page documents texmlapis-1.1.tar.gz\footnote{\href{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis/texmlapis-1.1.tar.gz}{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis/texmlapis-1.1.tar.gz}},
  but you can always find the latest version at \TeX MLapis\footnote{\href{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis}{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis}}.\par{}
