TeXML: an XML syntax for TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt)

     * Do you generate TeX code? Then download and try TeXML.
     * Do you convert XML to TeX? Then you ought to use TeXML.

   TeXML  is  an  XML  syntax for TeX. The processor transforms the TeXML
   markup  into  the  TeX  markup,  escaping  special and out-of-encoding
   characters.  The  intended  audience  is  developers who automatically
   generate [La]TeX or ConTeXt files.

XML to PDF -- TeXML vs XSL-FO

   Similarity:
   
     * Both  TeXML  and XSL-FO are an intermediate step in publishing XML
       as PDF.
     * -- In the XSL-FO way, you need an XSL-FO stylesheet.
       -- By analogue, in the TeXML way, you need a TeXML stylesheet.

   Differences:
   
     * -- Open-source XSL-FO tools are not yet production quality;
       -- LaTeX has been a reliable standard for decades.
     * -- XSL-FO is for good enough PDFs;
       -- TeXML is targeted to the minority to create excellent PDFs.

XML to TeX -- TeXML vs Perl/Java/Python/etc

   XSLT  is  very  poor  at  working with strings, so it is hard to write
   valid  TeX.  In  contrast, Perl etc. are excellent at handling strings
   and so can easily produce TeX, but they are inconvenient to manipulate
   an XML. The solution is TeXML.
   
     * XSLT  is  an ideal tool to convert XML to XML, and TeXML is an XML
       syntax for TeX.
     * A TeXML processor makes the rest, serializing TeXML to TeX.

TeXML benefits

     * LaTeX and ConTeXt support.
     * No need to bother escaping TeX special characters.
     * No need to bother about empty lines in paragraphs.
     * More than 700 unicode characters are mapped to LaTeX commands.
     * Support for international publishing.
     * Generated TeX code is human-friendly.
     * Open  source  under  the  MIT/X Consortium license. Can be used in
       commercial applications.
